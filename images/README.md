# Images Directory

This directory is for storing image assets used in the email campaign.

## Current Images

The email currently uses placeholder images from placeholder.com:
- Logo: 150x50px
- Hero Banner: 600x300px
- Product Images: 150x150px

You can replace these with actual images by:
1. Adding your images to this directory
2. Updating the `src` attributes in index.html to point to your local images
